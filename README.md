# Frontend Intern Take-Home Assignment

## Project Overview

This is my submission for the Frontend Intern Take-Home Assignment. The goal of this project was to implement a small web application based on the provided Figma designs, demonstrating both UI implementation and frontend functionality.

The application is a chat interface with two main screens:

1. **New Chat** – where the user starts a conversation.
2. **Active Chat Conversation** – where ongoing messages appear.

The chat flow allows users to send messages and receive predefined assistant responses using client-side state management. The application is fully implemented in React with TypeScript and Material-UI (MUI).

**Live Demo:** [NextDoc Project](https://nextdoc-shaktipriya.netlify.app/)

## Features

- Fully responsive UI (up to tablet screen size) closely matching the Figma designs.
- Two main screens:
  - **New Chat** – starts a new conversation.
  - **Active Chat Conversation** – shows chat messages and assistant responses.
- Chat flow simulated on the frontend:
  - User messages appear instantly.
  - Assistant replies with a predefined placeholder message.
- Continuous chat interaction supported.
- Clean and reusable component structure using functional components and hooks.
- State management implemented with **React Context**.

## Technologies Used

- **Framework/Library:** React
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI)
- **State Management:** React Context
- **Code Quality:** Functional components, hooks, logical and reusable structure
- **Deployed at:** Netlify

## ⭐⭐Additional Note

Due to the time constraints of this assignment, there may be a few features or refinements that I was unable to implement fully. I have prioritized completing the core functionality and following the Figma designs as closely as possible.

If there are any issues or areas that need improvement, I would be happy to address them after the submission. Thank you for your understanding.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <https://github.com/shaktipriya13/assignment_frontend.git>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <NEXTDOC_ASS>
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm i
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
    npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Notes

- All UI elements were implemented according to the Figma specifications, including spacing, typography, colors, and behavior.

- Placeholder assistant responses simulate a real chat experience.

- Responsiveness is optimized for desktop and tablet screen sizes.

- No backend integration is included; all functionality is handled on the client side.

## Important

- All code is written manually without using AI tools, as per the assignment rules.

- Code is clean, modular, and easy to read.
